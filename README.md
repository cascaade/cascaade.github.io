Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website. This will (hopefully) be updated with my latest updates, info, and achievements.
As of right now, the website is a simple, static page, and it will remain that way until I find it useful to add a backend.

**The latest update to the information on this page was:**
`June 11, 2025`

I really don't want to pay for a domain, so I am using GitHub pages for the time being.
