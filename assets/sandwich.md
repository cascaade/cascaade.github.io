It's been my dream for about a year now to create a robotic arm. Six months ago, I recieved my first Arduino as a gift, and I felt like I was one step closer. Over winter break, I attempted to start planning, but I didn't have any goal or design in mind. Now, summer just after the end of the school year, the opportunity has risen. You see, because my parents work throughout the week, I need to make myself lunch. What better way to use a robotic arm than to have it make me lunch!

## The Claw

With this goal in mind, I started my design. I thought it would be easiest to design from the top down, so I started with the claw.

This first design used gears on the grippers to control their rotational position, controlled by a motor that would be mounted on the bottom. I also added a gear that screws into the base of the claw so that the pitch of the claw could be controlled by a subsequent arm. I ultimately didn't like how this design looked, but I didn't have a better idea, so I put it to rest for a while.

**The Motor Mounts**

When I started this project, I had no clue how to make screw holes. I'd see some sort of helix tool on Onshape before, but I didn't know how to use it or what the best way to attach motors to my prints was. To fix this gap, I scoured the internet for inspiration. I found that a lot of people rely on heat set inserts, but I didn't want to spend any more money than I already had. Same goes for tapping threads. Then, I realized that I had some self-tapping screws that fit the little motors, and decided to make simple cylindrical holes compatible with those. However, I knew that the holes would strip if I tried the same technique on the larger motors, so I used bolts, washers, and nuts instead.

I decided to design a few test parts to make sure that I had the sizes down, and I am very thankful that I did. I had to print a total of _ test prints to get the tolerances correct, and that's just for the smaller motors.
